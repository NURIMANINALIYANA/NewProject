			Now I will tell you about my experience being one of the winner of the Green Folio Log Book Competition in conjunction with the Green School Program University Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)-UEM Land that being held at Kota Iskandar, Gelang Patah, Johor in 2011. I am so thankful and grateful because having a supportive family and cousin that helps me during finishing the log book on my own. It have the specific date on when the log book need to be submitted to the teacher but I forgot it &#128514;. The teacher that being in-charge to handle this event at every selected primary school is a teachers who teach life skills subjects.

			I am a person that if I got a task, I will do with everything that I have in order to finished the task because I don't like to postpone work. I will try to finished it before the submission date and my brain will be free because the work have finished. When we got this task to be finished from our teacher, I do my very best because I want to submit it. I gave everything that I have such as my energy and my effort just to make sure this log book can be done. My mother told my cousin about this task and she willingly to help me. She post some picture of me and my family that she have to me from her house because that pictures needed to be put in the log book. So, that is one of the reason that I win this competition and being a representative from my school.

		<p class= "type4" style="background-color: peachpuff;">
			Actually, I didn't expect that I wil win because I didn't set a high hope to win this competition. All I target is to finished the task, just only that. On Monday if I am not mistaken, when we have a morning assembly, I was not too focus on what my school principal talked about but suddenly, I heard she mentioned my name and my class and everyone around me were looking at me. I was so shocked at that time like do I make a mistake here? Then after she called my name, she told everyone that I won the log book competition. I just like don't know what to feel either happy or what because I am so shocked and cannot believe that I won.

		<p class= "type4" style="background-color: peachpuff;">
			After the morning assembly, I need to go to Kota Iskandar with my teacher to the rehearsel on receiving the prize on the stage. So, on that day, I didn't attend the class. On Wednesday, the selected class will join me at the event and we do a lot of fun activities that related with Green School Program. When it is the time for the event to start, I am so nervous. I received the prize from the former chief minister of Johor, Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman. He is so kind and sociable with children. That's was truly an honor to be there and participate in that program.
