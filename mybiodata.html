			Assalamualaikum and hi everyone! My name is <i>Nur Imanina Liyana binti Haini</i> or you can call me either Imanina or Iman.

			My hobby is listening to music and singing. Actually when I was young, my hobby is reading book but as I grow older, my hobby have change &#128514;. Also my ambition when I was young is to be a teacher whether in English or Bahasa Melayu or Pendidikan Islam. But when I want to apply a teacher institute which is IPG, I didn't manage to pass the eligibility requirements so now, I don't know what is my ambition because I took a course that not really into a teacher.

			1) Bihun Sup
			2) Patayya fried rice
			3) Tomyam 

			All of above are my favourite food and my favourite drink is Milk Tea. I really enjoy my favourite food and drink as I love them so much. <br> If I go to any food stalls or restaurant, I will definitely order that food as I enjoy it the most. <br> Even though my parents also know my favourite drink, so it will be easier for them if I ask them to buy drink when they go out without me.

			Besides, my favourite sports when at school is handball. I used to know and play handball since I was 8 years old. At first, I didn't know how to play even my teacher have teached me and it make me become hate handball. Even though everyday we practices to play it, still, I cannot understand and just follow what my friends do. But, I am so grateful, even I don't understand and get how to play handball, my teacher still selected me to join the handball competition. It is such a good experience in being one of the player that get to represent the name school since young age. But, when I am 12 years old, I fully understand the sports and love it so much. For me, it is such a easy sports to play and recommended to all students. I continue playing my favourite sports until university level. At a secondary school, I got to represent my school twice which is when I am 15 years old at SMK Bandar Baru Darulaman, Kedah and 17 years old at SM Teknik Tuanku Jaafar, Negeri Sembilan or known as <abbr title ="Tuanku Jaafar Technical Institute"> TJTI </abbr>. When I at <abbr title ="Tuanku Jaafar Technical Institute"> TJTI </abbr>, I got selected to represent my school to district level and Alhamdulillah, we got first place. It is such a nice experience in sport and make us proud of what we have done to school. I am so grateful because people get to see my talent in handball.
